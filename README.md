# Arduino project

This project, is a calculator with addition and subtraction operations.

## Computer Architecture discipline

In this project I used the **pyfirmata** and **time** libraries. And for the Arduino to Python connectivity I used the **Firmata** library (Alforithm - StandardFirmata), which is already included in the Arduino IDE itself.

And in this project we use the Arduino **MEGA-2560**
